      <span>
        Wiccan Rede, an ethical code that states, “If it harm none, do what you
        will,”
      </span>
      <br />
      <p>
        {' '}
        In this context that means if you are using a private water source, get
        the number on the door for the super, explain what you'd like to do,
        show them you have the right size water key, and offer something in
        return. An example of this would be, if you don't have a few bucks,
        offer to help take the trash out or hose the sidewalk, etc. If it's a
        watersource you use often, you might consider offering the building
        owner a reasonable monthly bill if it's a source you use a lot so we
        have a dependable source.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        {' '}
        If it's a non-profit, I don't ask but I do offer to help with the trash,
        wash the sidewalk, , but you don't necessarily have to ask. They are
        excempt from water bills.
      </p>

        I may add a public petition on this app to ask the city to allow
        homeless and houseless access to water at public buildings and public
        schools for a small fee, or even no fee.{' '}
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        Public drinking fountains and watersources are not my business but if
        it's a fill station, like a school, absolutely ask what the best time is
        and when the kids are not there. It will only take me one complaint,
        which I'll follow up on, before folks have to contact me for an account.
        This will give me access to your location and other relevant info that
        is none of my business, so that I may keep track of who is using my app,
        what water sources they are near, interested in, so on. I don't need
        this to go viral, but I'd like people to get help from it, so please be
        respectful and don't put me in a position to make a simple, public app
        more complicated and private than it has to be.
      </p>

        Please use the correct size water key. They are anywhere from $1-8
        Dollars. Please do not use pliers and strip the valve stems. Please use
        the form to add dependable water-sources that you vet. Thank you for any
        dousing you do!
