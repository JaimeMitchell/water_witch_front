          * Please, if you are using a private water source, get the number on
          the door for the super.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Please explain what you'd like to do, show them you have the right
          size water key, and offer something in return.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Examples: if you don't have a few bucks, maybe offer to help take
          the trash out or hose the sidewalk, etc.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * If it's a non-profit, I usually ask if someone is around and offer a
          hand. They are excempt from water bills, so tend to be a bit more
          generous.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Public water sources like fill stations and Public Schools, please
          ask what the best time is and when the kids are not there.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>* Please use the correct size water key.</li>
        <br />
        <li>* They are anywhere from $1-8 Dollars. </li>
        <br />
        <li>* Please do not use pliers and strip the valve stems. </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Please use the form to add dependable water-sources that you vet.
          <li>
            <br />
            * You can copy and paste the lat/lon coordinates in your current
            location,
            <br />
            or use the searchbar to get coordinates of the address.

        It will only take me one complaint, which I'll follow up on, <br />
        before this becomes another app you have to make an account to use.
        <li>
          This will give me access to your location and other relevant info that
          is none of my business, <br />
          which I will use to keep track of who is using my app, what water
          sources they are near, interested in, so on.
          <br />
          Right now this is just a database of water sources, not people.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          So please be respectful and don't put me in a position to make a
          simple, public app more complicated and private than it has to be.
