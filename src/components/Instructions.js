        <p>Building supers, employees, and tenants get really bent out of shape when you take a few pennies of water.</p>
        <p>To avoid a commotion and possible interactions with the NYPD over this water:</p>
        <br />
        <li>
          * If you are using a private water source, get the number on
          the door for the super.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Explain what you'd like to do, show them you have the right

        <li>
          * Consider offering to water the street trees or hose the sidewalk, etc.
        </li>
        <br />
