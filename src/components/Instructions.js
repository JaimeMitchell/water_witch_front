        <p className='wic'>Other things to consider when using this app:</p>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Please, if you are using a private water source, get the number on
          the door for the super.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Please explain what you'd like to do, show them you have the right
          size water key, and offer something in return.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Examples: if you don't have a few bucks, maybe offer to help take
          the trash out or hose the sidewalk, etc.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * If it's a non-profit, I usually ask if someone is around and offer a
          hand. They are excempt from water bills, so tend to be a bit more
          generous.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * For public water sources like fill stations and public schools,
          please ask what the best time is and when the kids are not there.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>* Please use the correct size water key.</li>
        <br />
        <li>* They are anywhere from $1-8 Dollars. </li>
        <br />
        <li>* Please do not use pliers and strip the valve stems. </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * Please use the form to add dependable potable/safe to drink
          water-sources that you vet.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          * You can copy and paste the lat/lon coordinates in your current
          location, or use the searchbar to get coordinates of the address.

          Nope, I'm not making a profit if you click on this!

        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          It will only take me one complaint of damage to the water source,
          which I'll follow up on, <br />
          before this becomes another app you have to make an account to use.
          <br />
          Right now this is just a database of potable water sources, not
          people.
